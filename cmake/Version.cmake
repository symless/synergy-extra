# Partially based on back-ported upstream code but differs in two ways:
#
# 1. We use `git describe master` to count changes since last tag only on master.
#    This is because we use squash merge instead of rebasing; using describe on the branch would
#    give us a superficially higher revision number.
#
# 2. We use a different versioning strategy; we work on the version that is being released rather
#    than a revision of the last version, so we use the `VERSION` file as the source of truth
#    for the version number rather than the last tag.
